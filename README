A command line program for Linux and Mac OS X to notify a user via the Notifo service: http://notifo.com
  
=== Usage ===

The first time you use sitrep on a machine, call it with no options, like:
  sitrep
To run setup and get everything ready. You can rerun setup at anytime with:
  sitrep --setup

By default, the message will be sent with the hostname of the machine on which it is run as the label.

Any of the following will send the message "this is a message".
  sitrep "this is a message"
  sitrep this is a message
  echo "this is a message" | sitrep
  echo "lots of data" | sitrep this is a message

All cases will return a publicly-accessible URL of the sitrep for sharing or documentation.

If data is piped to sitrep, it's packaged as a payload and delivered to the user via URL. Only the last line of the payload or the message passed by parameter will be used as the message of the notification.
