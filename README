A command line program for Linux and Mac OS X to notify a user via the Notifo service: http://notifo.com
  
=== Usage ===

By default, the message will be sent with the hostname of the machine on which it is run as the label.

Any of the following will send the message "this is a message".
  sitrep "this is a message"
  sitrep this is a message
  echo "this is a message" | sitrep
  echo "lots of data" | sitrep this is a message

All cases will return a publicly-accessible URL of the sitrep for sharing or documentation.

If data is piped to sitrep, it's packaged as a payload and delivered to the user via URL. Only the last line of the payload or the message passed by parameter will be used as the message of the notification.
